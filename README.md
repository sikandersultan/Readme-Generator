## Description

As a busy fullstack developer, I wish, oh so wish, there were an easy way to make readme file. Not just any readme file but a good one at least! WELL LOOK NO FURTHER, this is the application of your dreams. 

## Usage

This readme generator can be initiated in the command line and will ask you a couple of questions relating to your project. It will then automatically make a new readme file using the input data which might not be perfect but can give you a good starting point :)

## Installation

Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies for this application. Then run `node index.js` in the folder where that file is saved. It will start asking about your project. If you need further help, below is a video link to help you.
